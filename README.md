This repository demonstrates how to enhance the efficiency of Playwright tests by running them in parallel using Docker containers and test sharding in GitHub Actions.

Key Features:
Test Sharding: Distribute tests across multiple containers for faster execution.
Docker Integration: Leverage Docker to scale tests across multiple environments.
GitHub Actions Setup: Optimized CI/CD workflow for parallel execution, improving efficiency for larger test suites.
